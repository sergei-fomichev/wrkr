visualization.pdf shows the strongest cluster of user-at-keyboard data by only looking at the X vs Z accelerometer readings.  See the main page README for more information about these visualizations.

Color scheme:
 - red = typing at a keyboard
 - orange = sitting
 - purple = scratching head
 - blue = jogging
 - yellow = walking
 - green = standing still

By combining X, Z, and WMA data, we will be able to use a supervised expectation maximization machine learning algorithm to classify groups of data based on some probability of certainty that data falls within the "user-at-keyboard" cluster.
